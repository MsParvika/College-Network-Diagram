# College Network Design

Description 
The CNS (college network scenario) is about designing a topology of a network for an university in which different computers of different departments and in different locations are arranged so that can communicate and interact with each other by exchanging data.

Technology
CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate .CCNA is a well-liked certification in computer networking that is developed by Cisco Systems. CCNA is discovered by the Cisco, to identify basic capability in installation and maintenance of medium-sized networks. The technology is used for connecting various devices like routers, switches and different end devices to communicate with each other and interchanging data. To construct a methodical and reliable network, is scalable too. Portability is one of the characteristics of this work application of the CNS. 

Basic configuration (vlan,vtp,intervlan)
RIP v2 routing
Using PAT
Using NAT
Configure DNS and DHCP server

PRODUCT FEATURES - 
1. This network is based on client-server architecture.
2. Tree topology is used here.
3. All the departments are categorized into various VLANs.
4. Likewise, various departments limited into VLANs and share switches corresponding to their levels.
5. A request is made by any system of any department and it is forwarded to client switch which furthermore transmits it to the server.
6. Port-securities are there that are executed on various ports of the switches and gives reliability.
7. Multilayer switches are also being used to extend routers.
8. Protocol security is also taken into consideration for creating the secure network.
9. IP tables are being used to only allow secure traffic.
